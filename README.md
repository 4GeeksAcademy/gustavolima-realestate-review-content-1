# Data Cleaning, Data Preparation and SQL
<!--endhide-->

Data Cleaning and Data Preparation are two key tasks in Data Science world to later be able to train models. 
Using Pandas and Seaborn / Matplotlib I've analyzed the data and proceed to clean it and prepare it for later use it on a training a Machine Learn Model. 
As a safety precaution, but also for easier access of Data to thirds, I've created a SQL database with all the data from the Dataset, as a good practice. 

## ðŸ“’ Key Takes

Data Cleaning and Preparation is a very important task to perform on any data. There's not a "one-key-does-it-all" method, plus we have to take in fact that human subjectivity and how one perceived the data will play into the process. For me the key is to be the most unbiased possible, but when in doubt search for answers with professionals of the area, or investigating in to available resources to take the most possible correct interpretation of the data in the real world. Especially with Outliers like we can see below represented by the dots.

All in all, Cleaning and Preparing the data are fundamental steps, which are key tasks for any Data Scientist who want to train Models.
